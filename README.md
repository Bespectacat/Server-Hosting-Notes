# Service Hosting
Here's where I'll save some files, scripts and other relevant documentation to my self-hosting that others could make use of potentially.

Current documentation:

### Wireguard
How I serve things on the web. You can read my configuration and notes [here](https://github.com/Bespectacat/Server-Hosting-Notes/blob/main/Wireguard.md).

### iptables
How I filter and route traffic through my firewall. Configuration and notes [here](https://github.com/Bespectacat/Server-Hosting-Notes/blob/main/iptables-config.sh).
