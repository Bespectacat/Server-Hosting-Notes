# Service Hosting
Here's where I'll save some files, scripts and other relevant documentation to my self-hosting that others could make use of potentially.

As a general note, I am still quite new at this and am learning still to this day. My notes will be updated to reflect my knowledge as it grows and develops further. I hope that what I learn here can be of use to other people who wish to self-host too but don't know how to do so (or how to do so safely).

Current documentation:

### Wireguard
How I serve things on the web. You can read my configuration and notes [here](https://github.com/Bespectacat/Server-Hosting-Notes/blob/main/Wireguard.md).

### iptables
How I filter and route traffic through my firewall. Configuration and notes [here](https://github.com/Bespectacat/Server-Hosting-Notes/blob/main/iptables-config.sh).

### NGINX
[How I reverse proxy my services.](https://github.com/Bespectacat/Server-Hosting-Notes/blob/main/NGINX.md)
